# stop-and-frisk
Evaluating which people were stopped by police in New York City during the "stop-and-frisk" policy era. This project makes use of a publically available dataset on stops made by NYPD under the "stop-and-frisk" policy for the year 2006. I test the hypothesis, put forward by others such as S. Goel et al., that police were more likely to stop some people without subsequently arresting them, indicating that bias played a role in the stop.
